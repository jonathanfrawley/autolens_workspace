    "example script, which describes phase chaining and details the API for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we chain two phases, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both phases model the lens galaxy's mass as an `EllipticalIsothermal`, with the lens's light omitted.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The first phase models the source galaxy using a parametric `EllipticalSersic` profile.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The second phase models the source galaxy using an `Inversion`, where its `EllipticalIsothermal` mass model\n",
    "priors are initialized using the results of phase 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of benefits to chaining a parametric source model to an _Inversion, as opposed to fitting the\n",
    "`Inversion` in one phase:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parametric sources are computationally faster to evaluate and fit to the data than an `Inversion`. Thus, although\n",
    "the `EllipticalSersic` carries with it more parameters that the `NonLinearSearch` will have to fit for, the\n",
    "model-fit will be faster overall given the increased speed of each log likelihood evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Inversion`'s often go to unphysical solutions where the mass model goes to extremely high / low normalizations\n",
    "and the source is reconstructed as a demagnified version of the lensed source (see Chapter 4, tutorial 6 for a\n",
    "complete description of this effect). A powerful way to prevent this from happening is to initialize the mass\n",
    "model with a fit using a parametric source (which does not suffer these unphysical solutions) and use this result\n",
    "to ensure the `NonLinearSearch` samples only the maximal likelihood regions of parameter space.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- To further remove these solutions, we use the `auto_positions` feature of the `SettingsPhaseInterferometer`, which use\n",
    "the maximum log likelihood mass model of the first phase to determine the positions in the image-plane the\n",
    "brightest regions of the lensed source trace too. In phase 2, mass models must trace these positions into a\n",
    "threshold arc-secoond value of one another in the source-plane, ensuring the incorrect solutions corresponding to\n",
